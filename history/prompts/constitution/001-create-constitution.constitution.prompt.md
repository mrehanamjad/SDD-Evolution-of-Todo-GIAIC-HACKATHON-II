## Prompt

## Project Identity
**Name:** Todo Console App - Phase I
**Type:** Command-line Application
**Language:** Python 3.13+

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Simplicity First
- Keep code simple and readable
- One function = one responsibility
- Avoid over-engineering
- No external libraries unless absolutely necessary

### 2. Spec-Driven Development
- All code must be generated from specifications
- Manual coding is NOT allowed
- Specifications must be clear and detailed
- Iterate on specs, not code

### 3. User-Centric Design
- Clear prompts and messages
- Helpful error messages
- Confirm destructive actions (delete)
- Intuitive menu navigation

---

## Technology Constraints

### Required Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.13 or higher
- **Storage:** In-memory only (Python list/dict)
- **Interface:** Command-line (terminal/console)
- **Dependencies:** Standard library only (no pip packages)

### Forbidden in Phase I
- ❌ Databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- ❌ Web frameworks (Flask, FastAPI, Django)
- ❌ File persistence (JSON, CSV, pickle)
- ❌ External APIs or services
- ❌ GUI frameworks (tkinter, PyQt)
- ❌ AI/ML libraries

---

## Code Standards

### Structure
- Single file: `src/main.py`
- Functions for each operation
- Clear separation of concerns
- Main menu loop at bottom

### Naming Conventions
- Functions: `snake_case` (e.g., `add_task`, `view_tasks`)
- Variables: `snake_case` (e.g., `task_list`, `user_input`)
- Constants: `UPPER_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_TASKS`)

### Documentation
- Each function must have a docstring
- Explain complex logic with inline comments
- README must include setup and run instructions

### Error Handling
- Validate user input
- Handle invalid menu choices gracefully
- Catch and display errors clearly
- Never crash - always recover

---

## Data Model

### Task Structure
Each task is a Python dictionary with:
```python
{
    "id": int,           # Unique auto-incrementing ID
    "title": str,        # Required, max 200 chars
    "description": str,  # Optional, max 1000 chars
    "completed": bool    # Default: False
}
```

### Storage
- All tasks stored in a Python list: `tasks = []`
- IDs start at 1 and auto-increment
- No persistence - data lost on exit

---

## User Experience Rules

### Menu System
- Display numbered options clearly
- Show current state (e.g., "3 tasks pending")
- Allow easy exit (option 6)
- Loop continuously until user exits

### Input Validation
- Reject empty titles
- Accept empty descriptions
- Validate task IDs exist
- Handle non-numeric input

### Feedback
- Confirm every action ("Task added!", "Task deleted!")
- Show what was changed
- Use clear, friendly language

### Formatting
- Use separators for readability (===, ---)
- Show task status: [Pending] or [Completed]
- Number tasks consistently
- Keep output clean and scannable

---

## Quality Gates

Before submission, ensure:
- ✅ All 5 basic features work correctly
- ✅ No crashes on invalid input
- ✅ Code is generated by Claude Code
- ✅ Specifications are complete and clear
- ✅ README includes setup instructions
- ✅ Code follows naming conventions
- ✅ Functions have docstrings

---

## Development Workflow

1. Write detailed specifications
2. Give specs to Claude Code
3. Test generated code
4. If bugs → refine specs, regenerate
5. Repeat until perfect
6. **Never manually fix code** - fix the spec instead

---

## Success Definition

Phase I is complete when:
- All 5 features work flawlessly
- User can manage tasks efficiently
- Code is clean and well-documented
- Judges can run it with zero setup
- Generated entirely through Spec-Driven Development

## Response snapshot

Created `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with:
- 3 core principles (Simplicity First, Spec-Driven Development, User-Centric Design)
- Technology constraints (Python 3.13+, in-memory storage, stdlib only)
- Code standards (single file `src/main.py`, naming conventions, docstrings)
- Data model specification (task dictionary structure)
- User experience rules (menu system, input validation, feedback)
- Quality gates and success criteria
- Governance section with amendment process

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Project constitution established for Todo Console App Phase I
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.specify to create feature specifications
- 🧠 Reflection: Initial constitution creation sets foundation for spec-driven development workflow

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A

# Specification Quality Checklist: Todo Console App - Phase I

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] **CHK001** No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] **CHK002** Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] **CHK003** Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] **CHK004** All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] **CHK005** No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] **CHK006** Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] **CHK007** Success criteria are measurable
- [x] **CHK008** Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] **CHK009** All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] **CHK010** Edge cases are identified
- [x] **CHK011** Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] **CHK012** Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] **CHK013** All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] **CHK014** User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] **CHK015** Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] **CHK016** No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**All checklist items PASSED**

The specification is ready for the planning phase (`/sp.plan`).

## Notes

- All functional requirements use "MUST" language for clear pass/fail testing
- User stories are prioritized (P1, P2) and independently testable
- Edge cases are documented in User Scenarios section
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers required - the feature description was sufficiently detailed
